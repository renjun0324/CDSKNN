Title: Large-scale single-cell clustering algorithm based on optimal KNN graph structure
Version: 0.4
Author: Ren Jun
Maintainer: RenJun <renjun0324@hotmail.com>
Description: A novel single cell clustering framework that combines the partition-based clustering algorithm 
            with community detection method, aiming to discover cell types by constructing the most stable graph structure
